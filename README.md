I am a junior data analyst, I use data every day to build dashboards, provide insights and find business patterns using my skills such as SQL Tableau Python or Excel, I have done a variety of projects where I applied my skills to solve real-world business problems such as churn rate or examining sales, for example In a recent project, I conducted an analysis of sales trends and implemented inventory management strategies, utilizing inventory turnover and ABC classification methods.

Right now I am Currently focusing on building more projects to further expand my knowledge and enhance my skills.

I spend the last year developing my data skills by taking data courses such as Google data analysis certification where I learned the fundamentals of data and then I took some more advanced courses to improve my technical skills, as I progressed in my learning journey I was drawn to the data field and decided to pursue a full-time career in data analytics
